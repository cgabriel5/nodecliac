# Removing/Unlinking Completion Package

The `remove`/`unlink` commands take _n_ package names and have the same function: remove completion package(s) from the registry, `~/.nodecliac/registry`.

```sh
$ nodecliac remove <command> # Same as '$ nodecliac unlink <command>'.
```

**Tip**: Run `$ nodecliac registry`. Package should not appear in output.

Finally, open a Terminal or `$ source ~/.bashrc` current one and start using it.
