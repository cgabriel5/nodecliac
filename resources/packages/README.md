# nodecliac Completion Packages

> **This repo contains various in-house completion packages made during the development of nodecliac to showcase nodecliac's features/capabilities. As all CLI programs are different, the complexity of each package will vary. With that said, others wanting to create completion packages for their program(s) may use these packages as examples, guides, or reference points to get started.**
