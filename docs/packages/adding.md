# Adding Completion Package

### The Registry

In short, the registry is where all completion packages are kept. It is located at `~/.nodecliac/registry`. Complete information about the registry can be found [here](https://github.com/cgabriel5/nodecliac#registry).

### Adding Completion Package

While in the root of a package run:

```sh
$ nodecliac add
```

That's it. Once added, run `$ nodecliac registry`. The name of the package should be included in the output.

### Using It

Open a new Terminal (or run `$ source ~/.bashrc` in current one) and start using it.
